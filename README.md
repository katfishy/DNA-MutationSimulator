# DNA Mutation Simulator

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most prevalent mutations in humans, making them crucial to study. This simple app **mutates** single nucleotides in a DNA sequence and **identifies** single nucleotide mutations by comparing two DNA sequences.

### Features
- **Mutate** DNA Sequences: Introduce single nucleotide mutations at random or specified positions in a DNA sequence.
- **Identify** Mutations: Compare two sequences to identify the exact positions and types of mutations (insertion, deletion, substitution).
- **Generate** Random DNA Sequences
